# RealEstateApp
My final project from the OOP course where I developed a real estate management application.
My final project for the OOP course involved creating a real estate management application based on the concepts I had learned.
Buyers, properties, real estate agents, and contracts are all included in the program.
The program can also suggest properties based on the buyer's preferences and display the probability that each one will meet the buyer's needs.
